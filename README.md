# ParentalControlBypassiOS16
I found a bug to remove parental controls completely on iOS16.

My Parameters: (At time the glitch worked)
iOS 16-17 (Not latest 17, earlier renditions)
iPhone SE 2nd Gen
All Parental Control Settings Toggled
Uninstall Apps Blocked

1st step:
Run Ubuntu or your favorite Linux Operating System

2nd step:
Install libimobiledevice-utils and ideviceinstaller
Run ideviceinstaller -U CHOOSE.ANY.USER.PACKAGE
to uninstall any package

and it would reset the Parental Controls
on latest iOS 17 versions they have patched this
by blocking uninstallations via this method
i released it today after discovering that they have blocked it and i switched to an iPhone 11
if you can redo this glitch please add a committ with your info and images so i can get more statistics
